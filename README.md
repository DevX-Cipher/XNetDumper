# XNetDumper

## Description
XNetDumper is a tool for dumping processes from memory to executable files on disk. It is written in Qt C++ for cross-platform compatibility and provides a simple yet powerful interface for extracting and analyzing processes from memory, making it useful for forensic analysis, malware research, and reverse engineering.

## Features
- Process Dumping (Coming Soon): Dump processes from memory to executable files on disk.
- Memory Address Patching (Coming Soon): Patch values at given memory addresses for runtime modification.
- Memory Inspection: Analyze memory contents for processes and extract specific ones.
- Save/Load: Save dumped executables to disk for further analysis.
- Cross-Platform: Works on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- User-friendly Interface: Simple graphical user interface built with Qt for ease of use.
